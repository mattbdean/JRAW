# All methods that are not planned for implementation go here. Blank lines and lines that start with '#' are ignored.
# Make sure to specify both the HTTP verb (GET, POST, etc) and the endpoint's display path. The display path is just
# like the normal path, but includes "[/r/{subreddit}]" at the beginning. If you're confused, just copy the path of
# the endpoint you want to ignore from Endpoint.java in the main library.
